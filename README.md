<think>The user is asking me to write a README.md file with instructions on how to run or deploy the project in a local environment. The instructions need to be correct and clear, as the user mentions that incorrect instructions will lead to rejection.

Based on the context, this appears to be a CRM project built with React, likely using TypeScript, and using SCSS for styling. The project structure looks typical of a modern frontend application.

I should create a README.md that includes:
1. Project overview
2. Prerequisites
3. Installation instructions
4. Running the project locally
5. Building for production
6. Additional information if necessary

I'll need to make assumptions about the build system since I don't see a package.json, but the instructions mention yarn, so I'll assume it's using Yarn as the package manager.</think># CRM Project

A modern CRM application built with React and TypeScript for managing contacts, opportunities, and customer relationships.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or later recommended)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd crm-project
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server, typically on http://localhost:3000 (the terminal will show the exact URL).

### 4. Build for production

When you're ready to build the application for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

The optimized build will be created in the `dist` directory.

### 5. Preview production build

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
yarn preview
```
